# PacMan <img src= "PacMan1.png" width='100'/>
##Description of Project
This activity uses a loop to create PacMen moving at random velocities on command. As the "Add a PacMan" button is clicked, a new PacMan is created, which moves in a random direction and speed. When a PacMan hits the edge of the screen, it bounces off of the edge and moves in the opposite direction. Clicking the "Start Game" button causes the PacMen to move around.
##How to Run
To run this activity, simply load the HTML file onto your browser. Click the Add a PacMan Button to add some PacMen to your screen. Then click Start Game to watch them buzz around. 
##Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would like to continue working on this project so that when the PacMan hits the edge of the screen, the image changes to face the opposite direction along with the movement.
