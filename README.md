# PacMan
##  This activity uses a loop to create PacMen moving at random velocities on command. As the "Add a PacMan" button is clicked, a new PacMan is created, which moves in a random direction and speed. When a PacMan hits the edge of the screen, it bounces off of the edge and moves in the opposite direction. Clicking the "Start Game" button causes the PacMen to move around.
